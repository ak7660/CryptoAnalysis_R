# CryptoAnalysis_R

## Overview
In this project, I have explored the intricacies of cryptocurrency price movements by utilizing R for data analysis and predictive modeling. The primary focus was on analyzing historical price data of major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) from January 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023. Several prediction models were tested, including Prophet, Random Forest, ETS, and ARIMA, to establish indicators and trends that could potentially forecast short-term and long-term price trends.

## Key Findings
- **Market Dominance:** The results highlighted Bitcoin's market dominance and the strong correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as a noticeable correlation with Dogecoin.
- **Challenges:** Despite the application of various predictive models, the study found significant challenges due to the inherent volatility of the crypto markets, limited historical data, and the influence of external events like news which are difficult to quantify.
- **Model Performance:** The models varied in their accuracy, with the Prophet model showing some promise especially when configured with different training periods. However, even the best models like the Prophet and Random Forest displayed considerable limitations in prediction accuracy, which suggests that more data and possibly more sophisticated models are required for better forecasting.

## Conclusion
Conclusively, while the project demonstrated some level of success in using data science techniques to analyze cryptocurrency markets, it also underscored the complexity and unpredictability of these digital assets. Looking forward, the study suggests incorporating additional indicators, considering more altcoins, and refining the predictive models to enhance the accuracy and reliability of future forecasts.
